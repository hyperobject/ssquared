==
Please see [http://github.com/blockext/s2].

A blockext-based extension for the Parallax S2 robot. Requires the myro and blockext ([http://github.com/blockext/blockext]) Python libraries. Tested for Python 2.7, but should work with Python 3.x . Now works with Scratch 2.0 offline and Snap!.

To run:
* Download and run s2.py
* When prompted, input the USB port (starts with /dev on Mac OS X and Linux systems) in the window that pops up
* In a browser, go to http://localhost:3610 and download the extension for the block language you're using
* Import the extension file into your block language
* Enjoy!
